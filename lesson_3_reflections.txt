When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When sharing my content or made it so I can work remotely

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    because you can have better control on the commits that you pull.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks.- Copy a repository in github
	Clone.- Make a copy from a respository to you computer
	Branches.- Make a copy of your respository and you can merge them later

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    you might want to go back to that point in time

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Making branch for each coworker then merge when finished

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    when working with a different version to test new functionality or working with other people
